Here is the advice from the ESO support group on how to get the flux calibrated files from the other quadrants.  

> Apologies for my late reply. I had a look at your dataset.
   From the screenshot you sent me it is not obvious that the flux calibration did not work. In the 'Reduced' column all datasets have a green 'OK', which seems to indicate that the reduction went fine. The number of files alone is not indicative.
   I made an archive query of your dataset. When selecting the option 'Selected files + associated raw calibrations' I get full datasets for all quadrants. The 'MOS_STANDARD' files are present. See in the attached screenshot the example for the VIMOS file VIMOS.2016-0804T06:03:13.590, which in your screenshot has only 15 files available, seems to be complete with 29 files in the archive query.
   Maybe you have to run your archive query once more with the option 'Selected files + associated raw calibrations', and then try the pipeline again.
