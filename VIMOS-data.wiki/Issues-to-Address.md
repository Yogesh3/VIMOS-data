The following are the next steps that need to be taken.

* Use Reflex to flux calibrate the remaining quadrants
* Change all the code to calculate the error after binning the error spectra (perhaps consolidating all of the scripts into one big code?)
* Change binning to include the correct step size
* Associate the spectra with their target number
* Fix the mistakes in the scripts to work with the functions in the `specfunctions.py` file, and then replace the functions written directly into the scripts with the ones from the `specfunctions.py` file
* Improve documentation in the `specfunctions.py` file
